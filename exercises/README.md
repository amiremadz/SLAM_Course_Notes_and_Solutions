# Exerices of Course

## Octave in Linux (Ubuntu16.04)
### Useful Websites
* Installation of [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup/Ubuntu/)
* How to run [Octave with GUI](https://fredfire1.wordpress.com/2015/03/07/install-and-start-octave-with-gui-in-ubuntu-ubuntu/)
### Known Issues
* Every time entering Octave, need to `load` some necessary `pkg`s:
    * for example, `pkg load statistics`
    * I was trying to find an **auto load mechanics**, but I could find one with *Flatpak*
